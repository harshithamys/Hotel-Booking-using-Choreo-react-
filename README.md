Using Choreo for serverless orchestration, the app handles various backend operations, including booking confirmations, payment processing, and real-time updates without the need for complex server management. Choreo's integration enables scalable microservices, allowing the hotel to automate workflows and notifications seamlessly, from booking confirmations to check-out alerts.
